how to do this

make ajax calls to get all events in year
format: www.thebluealliance.com/api/v2/events/<year>
	import into 1-d array

then, get all awards from event
 www.thebluealliance.com/api/v2/event/<event key>/awards
 import into 2d of original array

 then, when looking for ranking of specific awards: chairmans, EI, etc.
 go through all awards, and get the team number that is stored in the array
 	one pass, store team number in temp var

 api call:  www.thebluealliance.com/api/v2/event/<event key>/rankings
 to get ranking of team numbers stored in temp vars

 add to 2 vars: sum variable(holds total sum), num variable(holds number of events added
 						(necessary?, can just use earlier array size))


then divide, get mean
